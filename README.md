This description is for installing NDB on Macos , assuming $HOME/git/ndb
will be used to create the project.

##Some Akka theory:
Actor: A worker concurrency primitive, which synchronously processes messages. Actors can hold state, which can change.

Message: A piece of data used to communicate with processes (for example, Actors).

Message-passing: A software development paradigm where messages are passed to invoke behavior instead of directly invoking the behavior.

Mailing address: Where messages are sent for an actor to process when the actor is free.

Mailbox: The place messages are stored until an actor is able to process the message. This can be viewed as a queue of messages.

Actor system: A collection of actors, their addresses, mailboxes, and configuration, etc.


##Install project from scratch
```
(go to oracle and download 1.8 jdk java for you maxos)
vim .bash_profile
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
(exit)
source .bash_profile
echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
(NOT NEEDED < ACTIVATOR DOES IT: install/download scala from scala-lang.org)
brew install typesafe-activator
activator --version
cd git
activator new
(pick scala-minimum)
cd ndb
activator test
(install free version intellij)
```

##To run the test code:
```
cd <project>
activator
clean
test
(The scalatest class , using akka test, will perform test confirming succes when a message could be processed by our Akka actor
```

### To create sbt project without activator:
```
on mac: brew install sbt and brew install scala
sbt
set name := "Hello-Akka"
      set version := "1.0"  
      set scalaVersion: ="2.11.7" 
      session save
      exit

and this to build.sbt:
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" % 
        "akka-actor_2.11" % "2.4.4"

sbt update

Run the project from ide:
        package com.nossin.dnb 
        Import akka.actor.ActorSystem 
        /** 
          * Created by user 
          */ 
        object HelloWorld extends App { 
          val actorSystem = ActorSystem("HelloWorld") 
          println(actorSystem) 
        } 

or:
sbt "runMain <package>.<class>"
 
```

========= Reactive applications ======================
the four tenets of the Reactive Manifesto (for web applications). These are the qualities that we will strive for in our applications so that they will:
 scale and be resilient to failure. 
We will refer back to these qualities throughout this book. The Reactive Manifesto can be found at http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/.

Responsive

Our applications should respond to requests as fast as possible.

If we have a choice between getting data in a serial manner or in parallel, we should always choose to get the data in parallel in order to get a response back to a user faster. Requests for unrelated data can be made at the same time. When requesting unrelated non-dependent pieces of data, we should evaluate if it's possible to make those requests at the same time.

If there is a potential error situation, we should return a notification of the problem to the user immediately rather than having them wait for the timeout.

Elastic

Our applications should be able to scale under varying workload (especially achieved by adding more computing resources). In order to achieve elasticity, our systems should aim to eliminate bottlenecks.

If we have our in-memory database running on a virtual machine, adding a second machine node could split the queries across the two servers, doubling potential throughput. Adding additional nodes should allow performance to scale in a near-linear manner.

Adding a second in-memory database node could double memory capacity by splitting the data and moving half of it to the new node. Adding nodes should expand capacity in a near-linear manner.

Resilient

Our applications should expect faults to occur and react to them gracefully. If a component of the system fails, it should not cause a lack of availability for requests that do not touch that component. Failure is inevitableâ€”that impact should be isolated to the component that fails. If possible, failure of a component should not cause any impact in behavior by employing replication and redundancy in critical components and data.

Event-driven/message-driven

Using messages instead of method invocation prescribes a way in which we can meet the other three reactive tenets. Message-driven systems move the control over how, when, and where requests are responded, which allows routing and load balancing of the responding component.

An asynchronous message-driven system can more efficiently utilize a system's resources as it only consumes resources like threads when they are actually needed. Messages can be delivered to remote machines as well (location transparency). As messages are queued and delivered outside an actor, it's possible to self-heal a failing system via supervision.
========================================================

Actors are not accessed directly, we get a reference. Actor System manages the abstract layer. By using messages, and not invoking methods pure encapsulation is enforced;
eg: scala> class ScalaPongActor extends Actor { override def receive: Receive = { case "Ping" => sender() ! "Pong" case _ => sender() ! Status.Failure(new Exception("unknown message"))
}

If you want to respond with an response defined by an argument, create a prop factory object, it prevents breaking code if changes are needed:

//Scala
object ScalaPongActor { def props(response: String): Props = { Props(classOf[ScalaPongActor], response) }
}
use: 
//Scala
val actor: ActorRef = actorSystem.actorOf(ScalaPongActor props "PongFoo")

Actorof creates actor and gives actorref}
anothe rway to get reference is using the actor path, a each actor has a path on a local machine, or remote using akka.tcp:some server.
To use it:
ActorSelection selection = system.actorSelection("akka.tcp://actorSystem@host.jason-goodwin.com:5678/user/KeanuReeves");



event driven messages versus blocking io:
Code does not obviously express failure in the response type
Code does not obviously express latency in the response type
Blocking models have throughput limitations due to fixed threadpool sizes
Creating and using many threads has a performance overhead due to context-switching

Message delivery:
Ask: Send a message to an Actor, and get a response back via a future. When the Actor replies, it completes the future. No messages are sent to the sender's mailbox

Tell: Send a message to an Actor. Any replies to sender() are sent back to the sending Actor

Forward: Take a message that has been received and send it to another Actor. Any replies to sender() are delivered back to the sender of the original message

Pipe: This is used to send the result of a future back to sender() or another Actor. If using Ask or handling a future, using Pipe is the correct way to reply with the result of the future


======actorsystem

is the main application , it create /user which is the guardian for all user actors , /system is used for logging, / root , temrinates
childs in case of exception.

=====================
Why ask is used? it adds overhead and complexity. Why not use a stateless class with a Future in it, 
Tell might be a better option. Tell use delivers a message. And a message using tell is returned. 
it prevents using timeout and extra actor creation. We need to build in some state and some internal timeout however,
eg context.system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(3 seconds, actor, "timeout")
So you got a sender and receiver actor, and the message is an object with the command to tell. All contain some state with a key to we know what message was send by what actor and to who.

The client actor will create a temporary actor and send with tell to our service actors. They tell responses back
to our temporary actor. The factor method to create it:

==========
//Scala
  private def buildExtraActor(senderRef: ActorRef, uri: String): ActorRef = {
    return context.actorOf(Props(new Actor{
      override def receive = {
        case "timeout" => //if we get timeout, then fail
          senderRef ! Failure(new TimeoutException("timeout!"))
          context.stop(self)

        case HttpResponse(body) => //If we get the http response first, we pass it to be parsed.
          articleParserActor ! ParseHtmlArticle(uri, body)

        case body: String => //If we get the cache response first, then we handle it and shut down.
          //The cache response will come back before the HTTP response so we never parse in this case.
          senderRef ! body
          context.stop(self)

        case ArticleBody(uri, body) => //If we get the parsed article back, then we've just parsed it
          cacheActor ! SetRequest(uri, body) //Cache it as we just parsed it
          senderRef ! body
          context.stop(self)

        case t => //We can get a cache miss
          println("ignoring msg: " + t.getClass)
      }
    }))
  }

===========

To all and use it: eg
//Scala
  override def receive: Receive = {
    case msg @ ParseArticle(uri) =>

      val extraActor = buildExtraActor(sender(), uri)

      cacheActor.tell(GetRequest(uri), extraActor)
      httpClientActor.tell("test", extraActor)

      context.system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(timeout.duration, extraActor, "timeout")
  }

==== Using forward

//Scala
actor forward message

Is just an actor sending the message to another actor (maybe handy for load balancing??)
the sender originally is also send, to the end result is the same. the result goes back to original sender


========Pipe 

//Scala
future pipeTo sender()
pipe(future) to sender()

Sometimes sender() is not correct, running on antoher thread. we can prevent this by sending result of s future and pass is to the sender. this is way better then this:
//Scala
val senderRef = sender();
future.map(x => senderRef ! ActorRef.noSender);
